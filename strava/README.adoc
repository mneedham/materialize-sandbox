This repository goes with the following blog post: https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/12/17/materialize-querying-json-file[Materialize: Querying JSON files^]

We can spin up an instance of Materialize by running the following:

[source, bash]
----
docker run --name materialize-sandbox -p 6875:6875 materialize/materialized:v0.5.3 --workers 1
----

Next we'll copy the JSON file to the container:

[source, bash]
----
docker cp data/activities-clean.json materialize-sandbox:/
----

And then we can connect to Materialize, using the `psql` CLI tool:

[source, bash]
----
psql -h localhost -p 6875 materialize
----

For queries to run against the database, see the https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/12/17/materialize-querying-json-file/[blog post^].
