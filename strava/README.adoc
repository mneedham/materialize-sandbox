= Strava

This repository goes with the following blog post: https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/12/17/materialize-querying-json-file[Materialize: Querying JSON files^]

== Installing Materialize

We can spin up an instance of Materialize by first closing this repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:mneedham/materialize-sandbox.git
cd materialize-sandbox/strava
----

And then running the Docker Compose configuration script:

[source, bash]
----
docker compose up
----

== Connecting to Materialize

We'll run queries against Materialize using the `psql` CLI tool:

[source, bash]
----
psql -h localhost -p 6875 materialize
----

== Queries

.Create source
[source,sql]
----
CREATE SOURCE activities
FROM FILE '/data/activities-all.json' FORMAT TEXT;
----

.Create materialized view
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW activities_view AS

SELECT  (val->>'id')::float::bigint AS id,
        (val->>'distance')::float AS distance,
        (val->>'moving_time')::float::int AS moving_time,
        (val->>'elapsed_time')::float::int AS elapsed_time,
        (val->>'total_elevation_gain')::float AS total_elevation_gain,
        (val->>'elev_high')::float AS elev_high,
        (val->>'elev_low')::float AS elev_low,
        (val->>'average_speed')::float AS average_speed,
        (val->>'max_speed')::float AS max_speed,
        (val->>'average_heartrate')::float AS average_heartrate,
        (val->>'max_heartrate')::float AS max_heartrate,
        (val->>'start_date')::timestamp AS start_date

FROM (SELECT text::json AS val FROM activities);
----

.Activities ordered by start date
[source, sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM activities_view
ORDER BY start_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

.Total distance run per month
[source,sql]
----
SELECT date_trunc('month', start_date) AS month,
       sum(distance) AS totalDistance
FROM activities_view
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
----

.Fastest runs
[source,sql]
----
SELECT start_date, distance,
       to_char(to_timestamp(moving_time / distance * 1609.34), 'MI:SS') AS pacePerMile,
       to_char(to_timestamp(moving_time), 'HH24:MI:SS') AS time
FROM activities_view
ORDER BY moving_time / distance
LIMIT 10;
----

.Fastest runs and average pace
[source,sql]
----
SELECT to_char(date_trunc('month', start_date), 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       to_char(to_timestamp(min(moving_time / distance * 1609.34)), 'MI:SS') AS bestPacePerMile,
       to_char(to_timestamp(avg(moving_time / distance * 1609.34)), 'MI:SS') AS averagePacePerMile
FROM activities_view
GROUP BY month;
